# Abstract for Assignment 4: Key-Value Store

This assignment, developed as part of the Operating Systems course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU), focused on the implementation of a remote in-memory key-value store capable of handling multiple concurrent client requests. The primary objectives included:

- **Data Storage and Retrieval**: Participants were tasked with designing a system to efficiently store, retrieve, and delete key-value pairs using a hashtable data structure.

- **Concurrency Management**: A critical component of the assignment was to implement concurrency control, allowing simultaneous operations on the data store while ensuring data integrity through appropriate synchronization mechanisms.

- **Command Protocol**: The key-value store was required to interpret a simple text-based command protocol, processing commands for setting, getting, and deleting entries, alongside support for resetting the store.

- **Server Architecture**: The assignment emphasized the development of a multi-threaded server design, incorporating a thread pool and job queue to optimize resource management and performance.

- **Testing and Debugging**: Participants were encouraged to engage in rigorous testing and debugging practices, particularly focusing on identifying and resolving concurrency issues.

The successful completion of this assignment required the integration of theoretical concepts from the course with practical programming skills, fostering a deeper understanding of operating system principles related to concurrency and data management.
